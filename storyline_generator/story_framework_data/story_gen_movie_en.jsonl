Truman is surrounded by actors who play the roles of his family, friends, and neighbors, all orchestrated by the show's creator, Christof.", "story_goal": "Truman's main goal is to discover the truth about his life and the world he inhabits.

Outwardly cheerful and compliant, Truman harbors an undercurrent of existential curiosity and suppressed rebellion. His identity as the unwitting star of a 24/7 televised reality show remains hidden until gradual anomalies (e.g., staged coincidences, malfunctioning sets) trigger his suspicion.

The breakdown of their 'marriage' accelerates Truman's awakening, particularly when she fails to convincingly address his growing paranoia.", "Marlon": "Portrayed as Truman's lifelong best friend, real name unknown. An actor deployed by Christof to emotionally manipulate Truman.
