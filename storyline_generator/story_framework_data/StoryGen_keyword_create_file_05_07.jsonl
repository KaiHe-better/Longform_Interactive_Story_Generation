The characters' actions are mostly consistent with their established personalities and the world setting. However, the sudden revelation of the mentor's true identity in episode 7 could have been foreshadowed more effectively earlier in the story. \n\nCompleteness (17/20): The story is largely complete, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The pacing is generally good, but the mentor's sudden change of heart in episode 8 feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more buildup. The story does a good job of tying early events to later developments, though some elements could be more tightly integrated. \n\nAppeal (19/20): The story is engaging, with a good mix of action, suspense, and character development.

The story aligns with the established world and character motivations. \n\nCompleteness (16/20): The story is mostly complete, but the sudden revelation of Liyue's relative as the antagonist in episode 7 feels abrupt and could have been foreshadowed more effectively. The pacing is generally good, though some transitions, particularly in the later episodes, feel rushed. Early plot elements do impact later developments, but more foreshadowing would enhance this. \n\nAttractiveness (19/20): The narrative is engaging, with a compelling mix of fantasy and emotional depth.
